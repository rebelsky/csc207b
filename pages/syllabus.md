# Syllabus

## Overview

Welcome to CSC 207, Object-Oriented Problem Solving, Data Structures, and
Algorithms!  The official course description is as follows.

> An introduction to the ideas and practices of object-oriented
computation: message passing, information hiding, classes and
interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, and reflection. The course
also includes data structures and the associated algorithms, packages
and libraries, exceptions, and the use of an integrated
software-development environment. Includes formal laboratory work.

My take on this course is that it is where you really start delving
deeply into what it means to be a computer scientist, computer
programmer, or software designer.  We will continue your exploration
of the design of algorithms, data types, and programs, but will
delve more deeply into tools and analysis techniques related to
each.  We will use Java as our programming language because it
supports some tools and techniques you have not learned previously,
particularly through its support of the object-oriented paradigm.
As in all Grinnell classes, we will also work on general skills,
from group work to "thinking on your feet".

### Accommodations

{{ site.data.info.accommodations-pre }}

My goal is to help you learn as much as possible in this course;
please let me know what I can do meet your learning needs. If you
have a disability that requires accommodations, please contact [Disability
Services](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/accessibility-disability/disability-services).
Disability Services will work with you to determine your needs,
and will provide you with paperwork outlining the accommodations you
require. Please give me this paperwork at least a week before the course
activity for which you need accommodations. If this timeline is not
feasible for any reason, please contact me as soon as possible and we
will work together to find a solution.

{{ site.data.info.accommodations-post }}

### Basic needs security

Any student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing
sufficient food to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable
place to live, and believes this may affect their performance in
the course, is urged to contact the [Dean of
Students](https://www.grinnell.edu/profiles/student-affairs/staff) or
the [CRSSJ](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/crssj)
for support. You may also notify me, if you feel comfortable doing
so, and I will do my best to help you identify and arrange other
resources.

### Textbooks / references

There is no required printed textbook for this course, as the
material has been written by Grinnell faculty and is posted on this
website.  However, there are some useful textbooks and references
you may want to bookmark or keep handy.

## Grading

My goal is for everyone taking this course to be able to demonstrate
familiarity, fluency, and excellence with the course concepts. I would be
very happy if you all met the goals above and received "A"s. The following
weighting of individual activities will provide a basis for evaluation.

Attendance
: penalty only

Participation
: 5%

Labs
: 10%

Assignments
: 25%

Quizzes
: 10%

Exams
: 30%

Final
: 20%
{:.dl-horizontal}

Some work may be graded by someone other than the instructor. However, any questions or concerns about grading should only be directed to the instructor.

The grading scale for this course will be:

A
: 93--100%

A-
: 90--93%

B+
: 87--90%

B
: 83--87%

B-
: 80--83%

C+
: 77--80%

C
: 70--77%

D
: 60--70%

F
: 0--60%
{:.dl-horizontal}

You may note that a score of exactly 90% could earn either a B+ or an A-. In
this unlikely scenario, I will always choose the higher of the two grades. I
also reserve the right to adjust this scale during the semester. You will be
notified of any changes, and the scale will not change in the final two weeks
of the course. You may ask me for your current grade in the class at any point;
I will happily give you my best estimate based on the current scale and graded
work so far, but *these estimates are not guarantees of a specific final grade*.

### Attendance

Your classmates and partner(s) depend on your contributions to learn
new material and complete the required work for this course. *Don't let
them down!* You are expected to arrive on time and participate actively
in every class.

Because your participation is so important, I will not grant excused
absences except in particular and exceptional circumstances. I will deduct
2% from your final grade for each absence and 1% for each time you are
late to class. These deductions are doubled if you do not send me a short
note on or before the day of the absence or late attendance
(e.g., "I will be unable to make it to class today" or "I apologize for
missing class today" or "Another instructor has asked that I meet
with them immediately after their class; I expect that I'll be about
ten minutes late to yours.")  I allot each student a 4% "penalty
buffer", which allows up to two absences (with notes) or four late
arrivals (with notes) with no impact on your final grade.  This
policy is intended to give you the flexibility to deal with or
personal or other issues (including job interviews) that require
you to miss class.

I realize that there are a number of reasonable and expected absences.
These include athletic events, academic conferences, course trips,
and religious observations.  Such absences do not count as unexecused
absences provided you notify me of them at least one week in advance.
I would prefer you meet with me early in the semester to discuss these
instances.

I understand that some disabilities may require you to miss class.
Ideally, these requirements are documented in your accommodations form.
But I will do my best to make adjustments and accommodations in all cases.

If you need to miss more than two class periods for an exceptional reason (e.g.
to attend an academic conference, deal with a family emergency, or due to
disability or long-term illness) please talk to me as soon as
possible and we will make an alternate arrangement.

If your are sick, *please do not come to class.*  I
would prefer that you reset and get better.  Please seek
medical care as needed. [Student Health and Counseling Services
(SHACS)](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/student-health)
offers health and mental health services to students.  I excuse illness
provided you notify me the day of class, preferably in advance of class.
I do not require a note from SHACS or your doctor.  Note, however, if
you are ill more than a few times, I may discuss the issue with student
affairs and may stop excusing illness-based absences.

### Participation

Because much of our work in this course involves collaboration and discussion, 
I will also evaluate you on your class participation.
Participating in class involves:

 - being present in class (physically and mentally)
 - coming to class on time
 - coming to class prepared
 - asking questions when appropriate
 - making positive contributions to class discussion by volunteering and when called upon
 - staying on task during lab exercises, and
 - working effectively with your lab partner(s)

Students who regularly meet these criteria can expect to earn an A- for
their participation grade. I will reward students who regularly provide
significant insights or guide discussion in productive ways with a higher
participation score. Students who fail to participate regularly (e.g.,
demonstrating a lack of preparation or involvement during lab exercises)
or who participate in counterproductive ways (e.g., by dominating the
conversation, making inappropriate comments, or getting off-task) can
expect to earn a lower score.

### Labs

We will complete labs in class almost every day. You will be asked to
submit a subset of the lab work via email for most labs. Your grade on
labs will account for 10% of your final grade. Labs will be graded on
a complete/incomplete scale. Writeups are due by 10:30pm on the *next*
day of class. In particular, a lab completed on Monday is due at 10:30pm
on Wednesday, a lab completed on Wednesday is due at 10:30pm on Friday,
and a lab completed in class on Friday is due at 10:30pm the following
Monday.

If you complete the lab on your own, you must acknowledge your partner's
contributions in your writeup. If you submit the lab together, only
one submission is required. However, all group members are jointly
responsible for ensuring a submission is made. (For example, if your
partner told you he would submit a lab but he forgets to, you will both
receive a zero.) For this reason, I recommend submitting labs while you
are sitting together and including all named group members in the CC:
line of the e-mail.

Submit your lab write-up by pasting the code or answers in the body of
an email (do not send an attachment) to [{{ site.data.info.grader_email
}}](mailto:{{ site.data.info.grader_email }}) by 10:30pm the day it is
due. If your writeup is not received by 10:30pm, it will be considered
late.

The subject of the email should be of the form ***[CSC 207.{{
site.section_number }}] Lab: Lab Title (Names)***. For example, the
class instructor might title a lab writeup on lists as ***[CSC 207.{{ site.section_number }}] Lab: Lists (Rebelsky)***.  Parties to receive credit
(i.e., you and your partner's name(s) if submitting jointly) should also
be on the first line of the e-mail.

**Grading**

Lab write-ups will be graded on a binary scale, 0 or 1. You will earn a 1 if
your write-up includes a solution or evidence of serious effort for each
exercise in the lab and a 0 if the write-up was not turned in or if some
assigned exercises are not attempted. If you were not able to complete some
exercises because of their difficulty, you can still earn full credit by
explaining where you got stuck and coming to talk with the instructor as soon
as possible. In short, every diligent student should earn full credit for lab
write-ups.

### Assignments

A homework assignment is due each Thursday night at 10:30pm, except when there
is a project or exam due. The homework is intended to help you learn and apply
some new algorithms and ideas, rather than merely checking that you've learned
the basic concepts (as the quizzes do). However, they are not intended to be
huge undertakings. If you find the assignments are consistently taking longer
than 4--5 hours, please talk to me.

I will give you instructions about what forms of collaboration are permitted on
each homework assignment, but generally you will be allowed to work with one or
two other students from our section.

When you work collaboratively on a homework assignment, only one submission is
required. However, all group members are jointly responsible for ensuring a
submission is made. For this reason, I recommend submitting assignments while
you are sitting together and including all named group members in the CC: line
of the e-mail. This also makes it easy for the grader to provide feedback to
everyone on the submission.

### Quizzes

Each Monday, there will be a ten-minute written quiz covering a few key
ideas from the previous week. Because lab work is done in pairs, the quizzes
are intended to check each individual student's understanding of these ideas in
a timely fashion (i.e., well before the examinations). If you (or the class as
a whole) are missing a key concept, I want to revisit that concept as soon as
possible so we can build on it in later lessons. Moreover, studies show that
testing is a surprisingly effective learning device.

The course schedule includes 13 quizzes; I will drop your lowest
quiz grade. Because the goal of the quizzes is to check that you
have learned basic skills, an answer that is basically correct will
receive full credit, even if there are minor syntax issues. For
code, my rule of thumb is that the code is basically correct if I
believe you could quickly make it work at the computer (and it uses
the required ideas). A partially correct answer will receive partial
credit at my discretion.

If you arrive to class late on a quiz day for any reason, please enter as
quietly and discreetly as possible. In order to avoid distractions to your
classmates, you will receive a quiz with whatever time remains and be asked to
submit it with the rest of the class.

Quizzes are considered timed assignments, so if you have an
accommodation letter that grants you additional time that is available
to you on quiz days. You should meet with me during the first full
week of class so we can determine the best way for you to complete
the quiz.

### Extra credit

To encourage you to support your peers, pursue wellness, and be an
active member of the Grinnell community, I will award extra credit
points for attending certain events or participating in certain
activities.  You can earn extra credit for up to eight activities,
with no more than four in any broad category (peer support, wellness,
academic/artistic), each worth an additional 0.25% on your final
grade.

### Exams

As opportunities for you to demonstrate your programming and design prowess,
there will be three take-home exams. The following are their due dates (10:30
PM), though they will be distributed 5-7 days in advance of the due date.

{% include find_dates.html url="/exams/exam01.html" %}
{% assign exam1_date = due-day %}

{% include find_dates.html url="/exams/exam02.html" %}
{% assign exam2_date = due-day %}

 - **Exam 1**: {{ exam1_date | date: '%B %-d, %Y' }}
 - **Exam 2**: {{ exam2_date | date: '%B %-d, %Y' }}

You should find the exams challenge you to go beyond what we have done in class.

Take-home exams are open notes, open computer, and open instructor. However,
because I intend the exams to assess your own individual understanding of the
material, **collaboration on exams is not permitted**. You should not talk to
anyone (except me) about take-home exams before they are graded and returned.
You should not discuss the exam problems (nor your answers) with anyone else.
This includes other faculty, class mentors, CS tutors, and any other student,
including students who are not currently in this course. You should not give
any information about your progress on the exam (e.g., which problems you have
completed or which you found difficult), nor should you ask others about their
progress. If you have any doubt about what is and is not permissible, ask the
instructor.

I will not accept late exams except in special circumstances. If you believe you need to submit an exam late, you must contact me at least 72 hours before the deadline or I will not grant an extension.

**Final exam**

The final exam for this class is mandatory.  Therefore I encourage
you not to make travel plans that will conflict with your final
exam schedule.  (It appears that our final is on the last day of
finals week; we will discuss possible options for those who must
take it earlier.)

Unlike the other exams, the final will be an in-class exam. Talking with
other students during the exam will not be permitted. You may ask me
questions. The exam will be closed-book and closed-computer, but you will
be allowed to use one double-sided, 8.5x11 sheet of hand-written notes.

## Deadlines

Work is due at the time and date specified in the assignment. Each
calendar day your work is late will reduce your grade by one letter grade
(exams excluded). Work must still be submitted by the due date if you
have arranged a prior excused absence.

Because I am concerned about your health and well being, I may also
accept late work (exams excluded) if

 1. you start the assignment at least three days in advance of the due date;
 2. you expend a reasonable amount of effort to complete the assignment by the deadline;
 3. you send me an e-mail attesting to facts 1 and 2 with whatever work you'd completed when the assignment is due;
 4. you go to sleep by midnight after sending that e-mail; and
 5. you make an appointment to talk with me immediately about any problems you had on the assignment.

*Deadlines for assignments involving programming will automatically be extended
by at least one class period if MathLAN is down for an unscheduled period of
three or more hours during the two days preceding the assignment due date.*

**Absolute deadline**: All work must be submitted by {{ site.all_work_deadline }}. This is College policy and cannot be waived for any reason.

## Academic honesty

{{ site.data.info.honesty-pre }}

As students, you are members of the academic community. Both the College and I
expect the highest standards of academic honesty, [as explained in the Grinnell
College Student
Handbook](https://catalog.grinnell.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=2537#Honesty
_in_Academic_Work).

Among other things, this means clearly distinguishing between work that is your
own, and work that should be attributed to others. This includes ideas,
examples, and code that you draw from labs and readings.

I expect that you will follow the collaboration policies in this syllabus and on each assignment.  In particular:

 - When you explicitly work as part of a group or team, you need not identify the work of each individual (unless I specify otherwise).
 - In most cases, you may discuss concepts (algorithms, ideas, approaches, etc.) described in the readings, lab exercises, or during class with anyone.
 - While take-home exams are in progress, you may only discuss class concepts with your instructor, class mentors, and individual tutors.
 - All the work you submit (code, experimental data, write-ups, etc.) must be your own or that of your group. You must appropriately cite any code or documentation you copy or modify, including code provided by the instructor.
 - You must cite all non-syntax consultations (i.e., ideas about algorithms, help with debugging) from any source, including the readings, labs, provided code, and internal or external language references. 
 - If you refer to another document when answering a question, cite that document.  This principle holds whethery ou're using the readings, your answers to a previous assignment of lab, a resource you've found on the Web, or, well, anything.
 - You must acknowledge and attribute any conceptual contributions by individuals not in your group. That is, you must give specific attribution for any assistance you receive. (This includes from tutors or mentors.) The suggested acknowledgment format is: *"[Person X] helped me to do [thing Y] by [explaining Z]."*
 - Any program results or output must be faithfully recorded, not forged. (A thoughtful explanation of unexpected behavior can often be a worthwhile submission and is much better than the alternative.)
 - You are responsible for safeguarding your work from being copied by others. This requires you to take reasonable precautions with hard copy printouts as well as file system permissions. (Note that MathLAN's default permissions prevent others from viewing your files.)

As an instructor, I will meet my obligation to bring any work suspected to be
in violation of the College's Academic Honesty Policy to the attention of the
Committee on Academic Standing, after which I no longer have authority over the
matter.

## Getting help

You may, as always, ask evening tutors for help.  However, evening
tutors are intended primarily for CSC 151 and CSC 161, and students
in those classes receive first priority.  Because knowledge of CSC
207 material is not a requirement for the evening tutor positions,
not all evening tutors will know the material.

Our class mentors will hold weekly mentor sessions, which will be
announced in class. Individual peer tutors may also be available
for regular, more intensive one-on-one tutoring. As the course gets
underway, please let me know if you are interested in regular weekly
individual or small-group tutoring. In some cases, I may recommend
individual tutoring even if you do not request it.

In most cases (exams and quizzes are notable exceptions), I am comfortable 
with you getting help from any other Grinnell student.  Note, however, that
you *must* cite any help you get.

You can also get help from me. Please come by during my office hours
to discuss the course content, get any extra assistance, or just
talk about how the course is going. Note that if multiple students
have similar questions or issues, we may work together as a group.

If you cannot attend my scheduled office hours, you may also email
me to schedule an appointment; please include multiple possible
meeting times (at least two or three) so that I can find one that
works for both of us.

I enjoy getting to know my students, but I prefer to reserve office hours for
academic matters. If you would like to have a more informal conversation, I
would be delighted to accept an invitation to eat lunch with you at the
Marketplace, a bag lunch in the CS Commons, or even to take a walk together and
chat.

Email is also a reliable way to contact me, but please allow 24 hours for a
response during the week, or 48 hours if you send an email over the weekend.

## Additional information

### Configuring your MathLAN account

Make sure to add the following line to the end of your `.bashrc`.

```text
export PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-11.0.1/bin:$PATH
```

### Working outside of MathLAN

While I require that you do your in-class work on MathLAN, you should
feel free to work on your own computer outside of class.  Because you
will be using GitHub to share your work, you should find it comparatively
easy to synchronize your work between machines.

We are using the following software.

* Eclipse 2018-12 is our IDE.  It is available from <https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/>.
* JDK 11 is the version of the Java Development Kit we will be using.  It is available from <https://jdk.java.net/11/>.

I do not provide guidance for installing any of this software on your
personal machine.  If you want to work on your own machine, you should
be able to figure out how to install the software.

### Formatting your code

I expect you to follow the guidelines in the [Google Java Style
Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) for any
code you write in this class.  Failing to follow those guidelines
will likely result in a loss of redit.
