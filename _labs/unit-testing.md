title: Unit testing
repo: <https://github.com/Grinnell-CSC207/lab-unit-testing-2019>
summary: |
  In this laboratory, you will explore the JUnit unit testing
  framework, Eclipse's facilities for using JUnit, and the basics
  of Unit testing.
---
Preparation
-----------

a. Make sure youâ€™ve read [the related reading](../readings/unit-testing).
You may find it helpful to have it open in a separate tab.

b. Fork and clone the repository at 
<https://github.com/Grinnell-CSC207/lab-unit-testing-2019>
(alternately <git@github.com:Grinnell-CSC207/lab-unit-testing-2019.git>).
Then import the project into Eclipse.

Exercises
---------

### Exercise 1: Getting started

a. Create a JUnit Test Case for the `c2f` method in the
`SampleMethods` class.  That is, 

* Select **New** > **JUnit Test Case**.
* Make sure that "New JUnit Jupiter test" is selected.
* Pick a sensible name for your test class, such as **C2FTest**.
* Make sure that the class being tested is `SampleMethods`.
* Click the **Next >** button.
* Tick the box next to `c2f`.
* Click the **Finish** button.
* You may see a dialog box that says something like "JUnit 5 is not
  on the build path.  Do you want to add it?"  Follow the steps to
  add JUnit to your build path.

b. Click the "Run" button and observe what happens.

c. Replace the body of the `testC2F` (or just `test`) method with
`assertEquals(0,0)`.  Then click the **Run** button and observe what
happens.

d. Create a second method that looks like the following:

```java
  public void test2() {
    fail("Not yet implemented");
  } // test2()
```

e. What do you expect to happen when you run your test?

f. Check your answer experimentally.

g. Insert the annotation `@Test` before the declaration of `test2`.
Then determine what happens when you run your test code.

h. Change the body of `test2` to the following.  Then observe what
happens when you run your test code.

```java
    assertEquals(10, 3*5, "stupid test");
```

This test is supposed to fail.  It's there to demonstrate that (a)
you can add a message to `assertEquals`, (b) you can include
computations in the body of `assertEquals`, and (c) `assertEquals`
treats the first non-message value as the expected value and the
second value as the received value.

### Exercise 2: Temperature conversion

You've seen how Eclipse lets you create and run tests.  Now it's
time to write a few of your own.

a. We know that 0 degrees Celsius is 32 degrees Fahrenheit.  Write
a test that verifies that `SampleMethods.c2f` computes the
expected value.

b. We know that 100 degrees Celsius is 212 degrees Fahrenheit.  Write
a test that verifies that `SampleMethods.c2f` computes the
expected value.

c. Run your tests.

d. If your tests reveal errors in `c2f`, correct the code.
Then run the tests again.

e. Write any other tests you think are relevant.  If the tests
reveal errors, correct the code and then run the tests again.

### Exercise 3: Testing simple sums

a. Read the documentation for `sum`

b. Create a new test class and write some simple tests for `sum`.
Note that you can create an array of integers with an instruction
like the following.

```java
    int[] values = { 1, 2, 3 };
```

c. Attempt to fix any errors that your tests revealed.

d. Write a few more tests.  Fix any more errors that you notice.

e. Consider the following test.  Does it meet the preconditions
of `sum`?  Do you expect your code to pass
the test?  

```java
  public void testExtremes() {
     int tmp = Integer.MAX_VALUE - 10;
     int[] values = { tmp, tmp, -tmp, -tmp };
     assertEquals(0, sum(values), "extreme values");
  } // testExtremes
```

f.  If your code does not pass the test (or if you believe that
your code should not pass the test because integer overflows are
supposed to break things), you have multiple options.  One option
is to fix your code to handle situations like this.  Another is to
rewrite the preconditions (e.g., "For every subset of ints, the sum
of that subset is greater than `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and less than
`Integer.MAX_VALUE`).  Another is to say that the test is so stupid
that it shouldn't matter.  _Which approach do you prefer and why?_

### Exercise 4: Writing multiple test cases

Read the documentation for the `expt` method.

Rather than writing individual test cases for this function, we should
be able to write a loop that does multiple test cases, something
like the following:

```text
Let expected be 1
For power = 0 to K
    Confirm that expected = expt(2,power)
    expected = expected * 2
```

a. Create a new test class and then add a test that follows that
strategy.

b. Determine if `expt` works as advertised.  It probably won't.
But debugging the code is a task for another day.  Instead, we're
going to write more tests.

c. Right now, your test only uses a base of 2.  Rewrite your test so that
it tries multiple bases, both positive and negative.  Strive for concise
testing code.

For those with extra time
-------------------------

### Extra 1: Removing A's

Write tests for the `removeAs` method.  Fix the method if necessary.

### Extra 2: Removing B's

Write tests for the `removeBs` method.  Fix the method if necessary.

### Extra 3: Sharing tests

Incorporate tests from other groups for `removeAs` and `removeBs`
and see if your repaired code passes their tests, too.
