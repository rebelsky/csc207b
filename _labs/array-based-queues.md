repo: <https://github.com/Grinnell-CSC207/linear-structures>
summary: |
  In this laboratory, you will have an opportunity to ground your
  understanding of queues, particularly of the array-based
  implementation of queues.  You will also continue to explore
  some other related topics.

Preparation
-----------

a. Open the [reading on linear structures](../readings/linear-structures), the
[reading on queues](../readings/queues), the [reading on priority
queues](../readings/linear), and the [reading on wrapper
classes](../readings/wrapper) in new tabs.

b. If you haven't already done so, fork and clone the repo at <https://github.com/Grinnell-CSC207/linear-structures>.

Exercises
---------

### Exercise 1: Code reading

Read through `ArrayBasedQueue.java`.  You will note that the iterator
is not yet implemented.  That's okay; we'll talk about iterators
in the near future.  More importantly, you may also note a few
subtle (or not so subtle) bugs.  If you do, write them down.  If
not, that's okay, we'll work them out in the lab.

### Exercise 2: Some basic experiments

Look at `ArrayBasedQueueExpt.java`.  Take notes as to what the queue
should look like at each step of the first series of procedure
calls.  You may also want to revisit the `ReportingLinearStructure`
class to recall how it works.

Run `ArrayBasedQueueExpt` and see if you get the output that you
expect.

### Exercise 3: Squashing bugs

You've probably determined that there seem to be some significant
bugs in the queue implementation.  Can you tell where they are?

You might learn a bit more about the bug by adding a call to
`expt.put("d")` before the first call to `expt.get()`.

Do your best to correct the first bug: `get` and `peek` don't seem
to return the correct value after some point.  If you need a hint
as to where to look, ask your instructor or mentor.

### Exercise 4: Wrap-around in arrays

If you uncomment the second section of code and reduce the size of
the queue to, say, 4, you may find that the queue fills before it
should.  (You may also have dealt with that issue.)

How do we fix that problem?  Normally, we "wrap around", so that
the back of the queue goes to the front of the array.  For example,
if we have seven items in a queue, and the front is at 4, then the
item 0 is at 4; item 1 is at 5; item 2 is at 6; item 3 is at 7;
item 4 can't be at 8 (there is no index 8), so we wrap it around
to index 0; item 5 is at 1, item 6 is at 2, and the back of the
queue is at 3.

Rewrite your code so that elements wrap in the specified way.  You'll
need to change `back`.  You may also need to change the code for
`isEmpty` and `isFull`.

### Exercise 5: Extending the reporter

The [reading on wrapper classes](../readings/wrappers) suggested that
we could make a one-parameter constructor for something liked
`ReportingLinkedStructure` that (a) sets `pen` to a `PrintWriter`
that prints to stderr, and (b) sets `name` to the class name of
the wrapped class and what appears to be a useful identifier.

Add that code and verify that it works as advertised.  If not, figure
out how to correct it.

### Exercise 6: Testing

Up to now, we've been exploring our linear structures by manually
comparing actual output to expected output.  As we've learned,
computers are much better than humans at identifying trouble spots.

a. Read through the `PriorityQueue` interface we've provided
to refresh your understanding of how priority queues are supposed
to behave.

b. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately), it is difficult to write
a test suite for an interface.  So you will instead write a test suite
for `BuiltinPriorityQueue`, which is similar to the `JUPQadapter`
from [the reading on wrapper classes](../readings/wrappers).  

Your test suite should be sufficiently sophisticated that you can
be relatively confident that it will catch appropriate errors.

The `PriorityQueue` interface tells you how they should behave, so
the only additional information you need is the constructor, which
has the following form.

```java
  /**
   * Create a new priority queue that holds up to capacity elements and 
   * uses order to compare elements.
   */
  public BuiltinPriorityQueue(int capacity, Comparator<T> order) throws Exception {
    // ...
  } // BuiltinPriorityQueue(int capacity, Comparator<T>)
```

Here are a few comparators you may find useful.  (In the future,
we'll learn how to write these more concisely using lambdas or
anonymous inner classes.)

```java
class StringComparator implements Comparator<String> {
  public int compare(String str1, String str2) {
    // Efficiency hack: If two strings occupy the same memory
    // they are equal.
    if (str1 == str2) { return 0; }
    // Safety check: If either string is null, compareTo may fail,
    // so we make sure neither is null.  We treat null as "smaller"
    // than any other string.
    if (str1 == null) { return -1; }
    if (str2 == null) { return 1; }
    // Finally, we can use the built-in `compareTo` method.
    return str1.compareTo(str2);
  } // compare(String, STring)
} // StringComparator

class IntComparator implement Comparator<Integer> {
  public int compare(Integer i, Integer j) {
    // While this method sometimes gets implemented as i-j, that
    // implementation presents overflow risks, so we choose a
    // somewhat more verbose approach.
    if (i < j) { return -1; }
    else if (j < i) { return 1; }
    else return 0;
  } // compare(Integer, Integer)
} // IntegerComparator
```

### Exercise 7: Adapting classes

a. Remind yourself of the methods specified by our `LinearStructure`
interface.

b. Skim through the documentation on the standard Java implementation of priority queues, available at <{{ site.java_api }}/java/util/PriorityQueue.html>.

c. Discuss with your partner how you would write an adapter class to make the built in priority queues match the desired behavior of our priority queue interface.

d. Look at `BuiltinPriorityQueue.java` to see how our implementation matches your design. 

e. Run your test suite.

For those with extra time
-------------------------

If you are fortunate enough to have some extra time, you might 
consider doing any of the following.

### Extra 1: Linked queues

If you did not finish implementing linked queues in [the previous
lab](../labs/linear-structures), do so now.

### Extra 2: Array-based priority queues

a. Read through ArrayBasedPriorityQueue.java. You will note that
the iterator is not yet implemented and that prioritization is not
yet implemented.

b. Make some notes to yourself as to how you might finish implementing
the put and get methods.

c. As [the reading](../readings/priority-queues) noted, there are
two basic strategies for implementing priority queues in arrays.

* You can keep the values in order from lowest priority to highest
  priority. In this case, the put method must ensure that the elements
  in the array are stored in order. (You can probably use a variant
  of the insert method from insertion sort to achieve that goal.) 
* You can keep the values in arbitrary order and search for the
  highest-priorty element whenever we call get or peek.

Pick one and finish the implementation.
