### Other good things

### Questions

_What should we do with the elements when we expand the array, given that there is wraparound?_

> Copy them.  I would find it easiest to copy them to the start of the bigger array.

_Can we talk about the reading, particularly approach seven?_

> No.  We'll explore the issue in lab.  After you've done that problem
  (or while you're doing that problem), we can talk more.
