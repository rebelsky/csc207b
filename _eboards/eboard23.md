Preliminaries
-------------

### News / Etc.

* Welcome back from break!  And happy April Fools' day!
* Review session tomorrow night: 8:30 p.m.
* We're continuing lab days!  Today's lab is (mostly) by PMO and AV (or vv).
* I will reserve the last twenty-five minutes of class for an initial 
  discussion of exam 1.  I will return the exam at that point.
* Wednesday's class is now a "pause for breath", mostly designed to
  support discussion of exam 1.
* Grading the exams took far longer than I anticipated.  I still do not
  have complete grade reports for other materials.
    * I have decided that I will now drop the lowest *two* quiz grades.
    * It appears I left the quizzes at home.
* Quick survey: When I write the next exam, do you want me to include
  "characters" (e.g., Tessa Ter)?
* I will be unavailable this afternoon and tomorrow due to a professional 
  meeting.
* Detour questions for Wednesday:
    * Do you prefer the PM/AV-style diagrams or the SR-style diagrams?
    * Do you prefer the PM/AV-style labs or the SR-style labs?
* Do you want the traditional "Sam wears a costume on April Fools' Day" jokes?

### Upcoming work

* Quiz Wednesday.
* [Assignment 6](../assignments/assignment06) due Thursday.
    * This is an individual assignment, rather than a group assignment.
    * You may consult with anyone you wish, provided you cite them.
* There is no reading for Wednesday.
* Please run the unit tests on your code from the exams.
* Lab writeup for Class 23
    * Problem: Your partition method
    * Subject: Lab Writeup for Class 23 (Your Names)
    * To: csc207-01-grader@grinnell.edu

### Other good things

### Questions

_I'll take questions on the homework and on Quicksort._

Are they all static methods?

> Yes.

Can I put them in the same class?

> Sure.

Did you say `Pair` when you meant `IntPair`?

> Yes.

Are our explanations in a .txt file?

> Yes.  Or they will be?

It's PM's fault, isn't it?

> No.

Should I worry about negative numbers in exponetiation?

> Nope.

Should we have a counter variable, or print something out and then
manually count lines?

> Counter variable.

Quicksort lab

Writeup:

* Problem :Your partition method
* Subject: Lab Writeup for Class 23 (Your Names)

Notes:

* Make sure to put the pivot back where it belongs (at the left end of
  the >= section).
* Return the index of the pivot.

About exam 1
------------

* It appears many of you did not understand the level of correctness
  (and therefore testing/experimentation) I expect on an examination.
* My preferred grade distribution:
    * 100% A.
* My expected grade distribution: 
    * 40% A, 40% B, 20% C.
* My actual grade distribution: 
    * 5 A range: 2 A, 3 A-, 
    * 7 B range: 3 B+, 1 B/B+, 2 B, 1 B/B-, 
    * 6.5 C range: 1 C+, 2 C/C+, 3 C, 1 C-/D+, 
    * 3.5 D range: 2 D+, 0 D, 1 D-, 
    * 5 F range: 3 F, 2 zero
    * Plus 3 ungraded
* I will be distributing a makeup examination on Wednesday.  It will be
  due the following Thursday (a week and a day later).  The makeup is
  optional.  There will be no homework at the same time.
    * You need not do all of the makeup.  Each question on the makeup
      corresponds to one question on the original exam and will replace
      your score on that question.
    * I will try to provide you with unit tests, although probably not
      until Friday.
* I will use most of Wednesday to discuss whatever issues you'd like 
  me to focus on from the exam.  Use one or more of the notecards to
  write down topics you would like me to cover, and I will try to 
  prioritize.
