### News / Etc.

* Please let me know when you see formatting errors on the class readings;
  it's usually that I've made a last-minute change and broken the
  markdown.
* Today is a lecture/discussion/recitation day.  We'll be working on
  designing some abstract data types.
* Did you cover implementing queues with arrays and wraparound in CSC 161?

### Questions

Notes from Friday's class
-------------------------

* On Friday, it is likely that you realized that Java determines whether
  or not a method exists at compile time, but determines which implementation
  to use at run time.
* We'll go through some diagrams to help us understand the issues at play.

The design of ADTs, revisited
-----------------------------

* Oh no, it's time for more PUMishment!
