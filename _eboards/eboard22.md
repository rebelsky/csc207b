Preliminaries
-------------

### News / Etc.

* We're back to lab days!  Today's lab is (mostly) by PMO.
* I was sorry to see so few of you at convocation.  It was among the
  best convos I've attended in recent years.
* I hope to be caught up on grading by the end of break.
* Do **not** discuss any aspect of the exam with anyone (except me) until 
  after break.

### Upcoming work

* Please turn in exams and cover sheets!
* [Assignment 6](../assignments/assignment06) due Thursday after break.
    * This is an individual assignment, rather than a group assignment.
    * You may consult with anyone you wish, provided you cite them.
* Readings for Monday after break: 
    * [Quicksort](../readings/quicksort)
    * [Osera 8.3: Quicksort](https://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/Courses/CSC207/osera/chap08.pdf)
* Lab writeup for Class 22: 
    * For those who attended class: Nothing
    * For those who missed class: An analysis of the space complexity
      of the basic version of merge sort and an implementation of the
      improved version of merge sort (including merge).
