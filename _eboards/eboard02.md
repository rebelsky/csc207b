Preliminaries
-------------

### News / Etc.

* Sit where you'd like (with reason); we'll move around a bit after the
  preliminaries.
* You should have received one email message from me since last class, 
  a notice about the Data Buddies survey.
* If you're not on the csstudents list, you probably should be.  Let me
  know if you'd like to be added.
* I'll take quick attendance.
* I'm teaching two sections of CSC 207 this semester.  They should be
  similar, but evidence suggests that when I "lecture", I do so differently
  each time.  I may assume that I've said something to you that I haven't;
  let me know when that happens.

### Upcoming work

* [Assignment 1](../assignments/assignment01) due Thursday night.
* Readings due before class Monday.
    * [Gettings started with Git and GitHub](../readings/git)
    * [The Eclipse IDE](../readings/eclipse)
* Quiz on Monday (and every Monday).
    * Summarize PUM/LIA
    * Simple Java stuff (read code, maybe write a little)

### Extra credit

* Thanks for folks who have been sharing suggestions!
* Getting extra credit.
    * Participate in the activity.
    * Send me an email of the form "CSC 207 Extra Credit (Name)", preferably
      within two days of the event.
    * The body of the email should include a reflective paragraph about
      the activity.
    * I will eventually respond and record the extra credit.

### Extra credit (Academic/Artistic)

* Opening reception for "The Incident", Bucksbaum Rotunda, 7:00 p.m. 
  tonight. (May be triggering.)

#### Extra credit (Peer)

* Watch some part of the indoor track meet on Saturday (starts at 9:30);
  30 minutes suffices.

#### Extra credit (Wellness)

* Kindness through grattitude, next Monday and Tuesday 11-1, outside DHall.

#### Extra credit (Misc)

* Data Buddies survey (distributed via email)
    * Folks have reported that it was mostly a good use of time.

#### Other good things

* Women's basketball vs. St. Norbert, 5:30 p.m. Friday.
* Men's basketball vs. St. Norbert, 5:30 p.m. Friday.
* Women's basketball vs. Ripon, 1:00 p.m. Saturday.
* Men's basketball vs. Ripon, 3:00 p.m. Saturday.

### Friday PSA

### Questions

Can I switch sections?

> Sure.  Bring me an add-drop form.

What are the group work policies for this course?

> _Labs_: You can choose whether to work alone or have a randomly assigned
  partner.  (I would recommend the latter.)

> _Homework_: You get a randomly assigned partner.

> _Exams and quizzes_: On your own.

Lab prep
--------

* First, we will figure out how many people want to work alone and
  how many people would like a partner.
* Then, we'll assign folks to partners based on those preferences.
* After that, you'll do the lab.
