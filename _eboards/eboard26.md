Preliminaries
-------------

### News / Etc.

* If you would like my code from Friday and promise not to distribute them 
  to others, I can send them to you.  (I need an email from you indicating
  that you promise not to distribute them to others.)
* I am a bit puzzled by the disconnect between "I had difficulty with
  big O" and attendance at last night's mentor session.

### Upcoming work

* Readings for Wednesday
    * [Iterating lists](../readings/list-iterators)
    * [Doubly and circularly linked lists](../readings/doubly-linked-lists)

    * You can bring your printed version to class on Friday
