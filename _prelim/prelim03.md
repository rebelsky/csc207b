### News / Etc.

* We'll follow the new partner methodology.
    * Partner names appear on the board.
    * See email about "Do not partner me with" option.
* I've responded to every lab that has been submitted.
* Please turn in your academic honesty policy if you have not done so
  already.
* If you're not on the csstudents list, you probably should be.  Let me
  know if you'd like to be added.
* Mentor sessions at 7:00 p.m. Sunday nights.
* You will have a substitute teacher on Wednesday.  I'll be off at the
  ACM FAT* conference learning about Fairness, Accountability, and
  Transparency in Artificial Intelligence.
* If you feel unsafe coming to class on Wednesday, send me an email message
  and I will treat it as an excused absence.  You are, however, responsible
  for making up the work on your own.
* When you send me questions about assignments, please title them
  things like "QUESTION on Assignment 2".  It makes it much easiere
  for me to identify them as questions.
* In case it wasn't clear from the syllabus and such, I will randomly
  call on students in class.  I do this for multiple reasons.
    * _It avoids bias_ (conscious and unconscious). Since I'm using cards,
      I am unlikely to ask more questions of people from certain groups.
    * _It builds skills_.  For better or for worse, many people expect you
      to express your ideas, even when you have not formulated them
      completely.  Practice in a low-stakes environment should help.
    * _It can remind you that you are not alone in confusion or
      misunderstanding_.  While I may sometimes force you to guess, you
      can feel free to answer "I'm not sure" when I call on you.
    * _It sometimes incentivizes you to ask questions_.  If you know
      that I might ask you questions, you may be more inclined to ask
      me questions.
    * And more.
* If being called on during class causes severe anxiety, let me know and
  we'll figure out a way to adjust to support you.
* I've updated the due time for lab writeups; writeups are generally due 
  at the start of class.
* You should be able to access everything on the current eboard by
  substituting `.md` for `.html` at the end of the URL.  
    * `md` stands for "markdown", a very simple markup language that
      I use when writing the boards.
    * I'll probably work on ways to automate the update of the HTML page.

### Upcoming work
