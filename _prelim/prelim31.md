### News / Etc.

* Smile, you're on (not so) candid camera!
* Today we continue our exploration of binary search trees, focusing
  primarily on how we remove elements.
    * Continue partners from Wednesday.
* **New policy** If your code is not formatted according to Google 
  style guidelines, neither the mentor nor I will help you.
* Do *not* use ArrayLists to implement queues.  That turns 
  `dequeue` into an O(n) algorithm.  I've provied a simple
  queue implementation that should suffice.
* With yesterday's illness, I'm a little behind (and a little
  discombobulated).  Sorry.

### Upcoming work
