### News / Etc.

* Mentor sessions at 7:00 p.m. Sunday nights.
* Ramadan begins during Week 14 this semester.  I will do my best to make 
  appropriate accommodations during week 14 and finals week.  College policy
  suggests that you must notify me by the end of this week if you need
  such accomodations, but I will make them no matter when you notify me.
* Make sure that you're using the latest version of Eclipse (2018-12).
  Many of the errors I've helped fix have had to do with old versions.
* I'll be using the whiteboard for a lot of today's class.  Sorry that
  things won't be recorded in the eboard.  (ASCII art takes too long.)

### Upcoming work

* [Assignment 2](../assignments/assignment02) due tomorrow night.
