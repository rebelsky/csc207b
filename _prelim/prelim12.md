### News / Etc.

* Whee!  More snow!
* I brought food.  (No particular reason.)
* Today is a lab day.  I *think* it's the right length.  (Morning
  went pretty well.)
* Today and Friday will mostly be a chance to re-explore some things
  you should have down in C, but in a slightly new context.
    * You may see these strange things called `Iterator`s.  We'll
      discuss those on Monday.
* You should be getting an email about the CPUS.  Let me know if you have
  questions.  (Computing Peers for Understanding and Support)
    * Informal program.
    * Helps provide mentorship/social support from an upper-level student.
    * Builds community.
    * Can be helpful for people from underrepresented groups (first-gen, 
      low-SES, gender minorities, people of color, etc.)
    * Free food at Grill or Saints Rest!
* Because assignment 3 was such a bear, I'm giving everyone full credit.
  (Comments will come later, perhaps much later.)
* I _think_ I've set up the system so that our eboard auto-updates every
  five minutes or so during class.
