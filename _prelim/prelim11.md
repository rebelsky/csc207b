### News / Etc.

* _Welcome to any prospective students who may be here._
    * Since we may have prospectives, the quiz will be at the end of
      class, rather than the beginning.
* Please let me know when you see formatting errors on the class readings;
  it's usually that I've made a last-minute change and broken the
  markdown.
* Sorry for issues on the Web site.  Jekyll was not cooperating.
* Today is a lecture/discussion/recitation day.  We'll be working on
  designing some abstract data types.

  Yes.  Yay!
