### Other things

This appeared in the _Campus Memo_.  While it is a public presentation,
I am told that it's not geared for students.  However, I will also note
that students who have attended past budget presentations have told me that
they found it enlightening.

The Budget Presentation  
Monday, May 13  
4 p.m., Joe Rosenfield '25 Center, Room 101

Faculty and staff are invited to a presentation that will review the annual budg
et process, the recently approved FY20 budget, and a general budget outlook, pre
pared by Keith Archer, vice president for finance and treasurer, Joe Bagnoli, vi
ce president for enrollment and dean of admission and financial aid, and Jainen 
Thayer, chief investment officer.

### Final PSA of the semester

* Don't let the stress of finals' week negatively affect you.
    * Get enough sleep.
    * If you decide to shut off your brain with substances, do so in moderation.
    * Don't let academic honesty become an issue; our decision-making becomes
      less good at this time of the semester.
* Consent is essential.
