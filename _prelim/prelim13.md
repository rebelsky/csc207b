### News / Etc.

* Continue partners from Wednesday!
* Mentor Session Sunday at 8 p.m.
* Beware!  Today is Friday the 13th (Class)
* Today is a lab day.  I *think* it's the right length.
* Quiz 4 returned.
    * Don't write `if ((val % this.div) == 0) { return true; } else { return false; }`
      Write `return (val % this.div) == 0;`
    * Subtype polymorphism and parameteric polymorphism don't always mix well.
      If `C` implements `I`, you cannot assign a value of type
      `Box<C>` to a variable of type `Box<I>`.
* Recommended approach to starting homework (after reading)
    * Create a project in Eclipse, choosing an appropriate place for
      the directory.
    * Add your primary package (if there is one).
    * Create a repo on GitHub (no README)
    * cd to that directory
    * Follow the GitHub instructions for linking the directory to
      the repo.
    * Add all the files Eclipse generates.
    * Push.
    * Share the repository with your partner and me.
* Some of you are getting messages like *Integer type is not visible*
  and *String type is not visible* in Eclipse.  I have no idea why and
  can't usually reproduce the issue.  I've found that creating a new repo
  and copying files into that often fixes it.  Once again, I'm not sure
  why.
    * My suspicion: Some of the code came from copying-and-pasting from
      Office365, and that sometimes inserts hidden characters.
