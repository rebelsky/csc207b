### News / Etc.

* For the exam, make sure to put each test in the correct directory and 
  the new version of `TestUtils.java` in the `utils` directory.
* Note: A lot of today's lab is "think about how to design code, then
  compare to my design".  You will find the lab most beneficial if you
  actually spend the time thinking and comparing.
