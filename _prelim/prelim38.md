### News / Etc.

* I'm mostly through grading exam 2; there were enough issues that I'm
  going to talk through some of them and give you a chance to resubmit.
    * Some lost folks points.  (Hence the "resubmit".)
    * However, most are just general issues.
* Since I'm bringing food to the CSC 151 students' presentations, I brought 
  some for you too.  (You get melon and poptarts; they get PB&J and other
  fruit, plus your leftovers.)

### Upcoming work

* Reading for Wednesday
    * [Wikipedia: Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
* No lab writeup today.
* [Exam 2](../exams/exam02) due last night.   (Tuesday is also acceptable.)
    * Don't forget your epilogue!
* Final exam: 9am or 2pm, Thursday or Friday of finals week.
    * I'll try to have a sample final ready early next week.
    * Let me know which of the four times you plan to take the final.
