### News / Etc.

* Sit where you'd like (with reason); we'll move around a bit after the
  preliminaries.
* You should have received one email message from me since last class, 
  a notice about the Data Buddies survey.
* If you're not on the csstudents list, you probably should be.  Let me
  know if you'd like to be added.
* I'll take quick attendance.
* I'm teaching two sections of CSC 207 this semester.  They should be
  similar, but evidence suggests that when I "lecture", I do so differently
  each time.  I may assume that I've said something to you that I haven't;
  let me know when that happens.
* Mentor sessions at time TBD (Sunday nights).  Doodle poll coming.  
* Anh Thu is an SEPC member, feel free to let her know your thoughts
  about the department (or this class) and she will relay them anonymously.

### Upcoming work

* [Assignment 1](../assignments/assignment01) due Thursday night.
* Readings due before class Monday.
    * [Gettings started with Git and GitHub](../readings/git)
    * [The Eclipse IDE](../readings/eclipse)
* Quiz on Monday (and every Monday).
    * Summarize PUM/LIA
    * Simple Java stuff (read code, maybe write a little)

### Extra credit

* Thanks for folks who have been sharing suggestions!
* Getting extra credit.
    * Participate in the activity.
    * Send me an email of the form "CSC 207 Extra Credit (Name)", preferably
      within two days of the event.
    * The body of the email should include a reflective paragraph about
      the activity.
    * I will eventually respond and record the extra credit.

#### Extra credit (Academic/Artistic)

* Opening reception for "The Incident", Bucksbaum Rotunda, 7:00 p.m. 
  tonight. (May be triggering.)

#### Extra credit (Peer)

  30 minutes suffices.

#### Extra credit (Misc)
