### News / Etc.

* I think today sets a new record for the length of the preliminaries.
* **The computer ate yesterday's eboard.  Sorry.  Look at [the eboard
  from CSC 207.02](../../02/eboards/eboard32) for similar details.**
* I plan to return makeup exams on Friday.
* The College has decided to institute electronic end-of-course evaluations.
  You should be getting information about them next week.  We will do
  evaluations in class on the last day of class, so you should not be able
  to access this class's EOCEs before then.
* Next week's Science Teaching and Learning Group will discuss student
  wellness.  I'm hoping to share some of the extra credit reports you've
  submitted (anonymously).  Let me know if you object to me sharing yours.
* Since there were some questions about Monday's quiz, we'll spend
  some time discussing the various issues and approaches.
* Given how quizzes have gone this semester, I'm not counting them in 
  your final grade.  (Or I'm counting them based on the percentage you
  took.)
* You should think about taking HIS 295, which approaches some computational topics from a very different perspective.

    > _HIS 295 Digital History: Investigating the Past_. This course will introduce students to methods used in the digital humanities, with a special emphasis on applications to historical studies. Students will create projects and study existing digital projects, with a special focus on U.S. History in a global context. Readings will include primary sources as well as recent contributions to theory in digital humanities. We will learn general principles of working with humanistic data as well as techniques such as building on-line exhibitions, digital mapping, and computational analysis of text. No technical skills or experience in digital humanities work are required, but willingness to gain both are fundamental to the class. Prerequisite: HIS-100 or second-year standing.

### Upcoming work

* No additional reading!  (But you may want to review.)
* [Assignment 8](../assignments/assignment08) due Thursday the 25th
* Exam 2 to be distributed Friday.
* Today's lab writeup: TBD

### Extra credit

#### Extra credit (Academic/Artistic)

* **Tomorrow**: PBK Convo, Thursday, 11am: "Antievolutionism in Historical Perspective"

    > Guest Artist Carol Burch-Brown is the creator of “Salt Marsh Suite” a collaborative inter-media arts installation and dance performance based in fieldwork, data collection, and close observation of a North Carolina coastal estuary.
Join us on Thursday April 25th at 11AM in the Flanagan Theatre to see the installation, and hear Carol talk about the digital art-making processes, specifically theerror. MAX coding environment, and other digital tools she used to make this unique work.

* **New**: CS Table, next Tuesday, Big data and Facebook
* **New**: Three talks by Prof. Dr. Yvonne Foerster (<https://yvonnefoerster.com/>)

    > Wednesday: May 1, 4:30-6pm, HSSC S3325: _Beyond the Anthropocene: Technology, Innovation, and the (Post-)Human Condition_

    > Emergent technologies today are advertised as means to create a better future, while the futures imagined in popular science and culture move rather towards the transcendence of human life. This talk examines the conception of innovation between the technological enthusiasm to overcome human limitations and the necessity to critically reflect on the (post-)human condition.

    > Thursday, May 2, Noon-12:50pm, HSSC N3110 _Degrees of Freedom: Embodiment, Neuroplasticity, and the Need for a Critical Neuroscience_

    > Lunch and beverages provided

    > Neuroplasticity, the ability of the brain to adjust to new affordances and to overcome limitations through damage, has been part of a discourse that celebrated freedom rather than neuro-determinism. My aim is to discuss this concept with regard to the rise of neurocultures (e.g., enhancement strategies, neuromarketing) in a more critical light.

    > Friday, May 3, Noon-12:50pm, Bucksbaum 152: _Designing Future Bodies: Fashion and Technology_

    > Lunch and beverages provided

    > Fashion and technology are inextricably linked in production, marketing, design, and functionality. In this talk I shed some light on the potential of fashion to critically examine the role of technology in shaping bodies, gender, and social relations. I will take a closer look at experimental practices and scientific cooperation in the field of fashion.
