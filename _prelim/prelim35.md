### News / Etc.

* I brought food-like substances.
* Today and Wednesday are "talk days".
* Apologies: Grading time this weekend got consumed by test writing 
  and question answering.
    * It sucks when there are bugs in your tests.

### Upcoming work

* No reading for Wednesday.
* No lab writeup today.
* [Exam 2](../exams/exam02) due Thursday.
    * Prologue due **tonight**.

### Exam 2 Notes

* Make sure that your repo is private!
* Don't just hack at it until it works; 
  Take a step back, draw, think, and run by hand.
* "Where does `add` add the element?"  "What should `remove` do if the 
  key is not there?" - Read the documentation.  (For things related to
  `ListIterator`s, you can also see what happens in `ArrayList`s.)
* Some extra credit for inappropriate tests of Tries.
