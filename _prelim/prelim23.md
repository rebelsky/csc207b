### News / Etc.

* Welcome back from break!  And happy April Fools' day!
* We're continuing lab days!  Today's lab is (mostly) by PMO and AV (or vv).
* I will reserve the last twenty-five minutes of class for an initial 
  discussion of exam 1.  I will return the exam at that point.
* Wednesday's class is now a "pause for breath", mostly designed to
  support discussion of exam 1.
* Grading the exams took far longer than I anticipated.  I still do not
  have complete grade reports for other materials.
    * I have decided that I will now drop the lowest *two* quiz grades.
    * It appears I left the quizzes at home.
* Quick survey: When I write the next exam, do you want me to include
  "characters" (e.g., Tessa Ter)?
* I will be unavailable this afternoon and tomorrow due to a professional 
  meeting.
* Detour questions for Wednesday:
    * Do you prefer the PM/AV-style diagrams or the SR-style diagrams?
    * Do you prefer the PM/AV-style labs or the SR-style labs?
* Do you want the traditional "Sam wears a costume on April Fools' Day" jokes?

### Upcoming work

* [Assignment 6](../assignments/assignment06) due Thursday.
    * This is an individual assignment, rather than a group assignment.
    * You may consult with anyone you wish, provided you cite them.
* There is no reading for Wednesday.
* Lab writeup for Class 23
    * Problem: Your partition method.
    * Subject: Lab Writeup for Class 23 (Your Names)
