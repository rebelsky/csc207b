### News / Etc.

* Mentor sessions at 7:00 p.m. Sunday nights.
* Ramadan begins during Week 14 this semester.  I will do my best to make 
  appropriate accommodations during week 14 and finals week.  College policy
  suggests that you must notify me by the end of this week if you need
  such accomodations, but I will make them no matter when you notify me.
* The "Current Writeup" link should now be working.
* I graded any lab 4's I received by 7pm Sunday night.  Make sure you
  let me know if you know you're submitting non-working code on labs.
* To make sure that you have enough time for lab, I'll try to avoid
  much talking today.
* JUnit's API changed significantly from JUnit4 to JUnit5.  I think I've
  caught all of the code that needed changing, but there may be a few left.
* Due to a confluence of circumstances, it appears we will have few MAPs
  in the department this summer.  Check with JW and CC for details on 
  their MAPs.

### Upcoming work

* [Assignment 2](../assignments/assignment02) due Thursday night.
