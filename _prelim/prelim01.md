### News / Etc.

* Welcome to CSC207!
* I'm Sam (or SamR)
* Our class mentors are Anh Thu (section 1) and Shuyi (section 2)
* You should have received one handout at the start of class
    * The [CS Department Academic Honesty Policy](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/academic-honesty-policy)
* Since it's the first day of class, I will take attendance.  (_It will take
  me a few weeks to learn all of your names._)
    * "Hi, my name is FORENAME SURNAME."
    * "You can call me PRIMARY_NAME."
    * "If you must address me by surname, you can call me
      Mr./Ms./Mx./[nothing] SURNAME."
    * Optional: "During winter break, I ..."
    * Optional: "My pronouns are ...."
* For some reason, I ended up with copies of 151 handouts in the handouts
  section of this course.  I've updated [the page on
  grading](../handouts/grading) and [the page on note-taking](taking-notes)
* I realize that PUM and LIA (from the readings) are horrid acronyms.  If
  you have better ones, I'd appreciate it.
* We'll be using two "books" for this course: The readings I write (or
  wrote) and the material that Peter-Michael wrote.  There's a link
  to his book under the Reference menu.  You can grab either the whole
  book or individual chapters.
* I'm teaching two sections of CSC 207 this semester.  I'm not yet sure
  of all the implications.  One is that I'm likely to assume I've said
  something in one class when I've said it in another.
* I'm trying to be less snarky this semester.  Call me on it.

### Upcoming work

* [Assignment 1](../assignments/assignment01) due Thursday night (not tomorrow).
