### News / Etc.

* Welcome to CSC207!
* I'm Sam (or SamR)
* Our class mentors are Anh Thu (section 1) and Zander (section 2)
* You should have received two handouts at the start of class
    * A playing card.
    * The [CS Department Academic Honesty Policy](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/academic-honesty-policy)
* Since it's the first day of class, I will take attendance.  (_It will take
  me a few weeks to learn all of your names._)
    * "Hi, my name is FORENAME SURNAME."
    * "You can call me PRIMARY_NAME."
    * "If you must address me by surname, you can call me
      Mr./Ms./Mx./[nothing] SURNAME."
    * "I'm from ..."
    * Optional: "My pronouns are ...."
* I realize that PUM and LIA (from the readings) are horrid acronyms.  If
  you have better ones, I'd appreciate it.

### Upcoming work

* Readings due before class Friday.
